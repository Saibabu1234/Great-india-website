		<h2>India Before & After</h2>
		<p align="center">Before gaining independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India endured nearly two centuries of foreign domination marked by exploitation and socio-economic disparities. The British Empire had a stranglehold on India's resources, leading to widespread poverty and inequality. The pre-independence period was also characterized by a long and non-violent freedom struggle led by luminaries like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and others who championed India's cause for self-determination.</p>

		<div>
			<p align="center">After gaining independence, India emerged as a sovereign nation on August 15, 1947, with a democratic system of governance. The post-independence era witnessed significant strides in economic development, infrastructure expansion, and social welfare initiatives aimed at reducing poverty and improving living standards. India's democracy evolved to accommodate its vast and diverse population, fostering cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity. While the nation encountered challenges such as regional conflicts, poverty, and governance issues, it also achieved remarkable progress in areas like technology, education, healthcare, and space exploration, solidifying its position as a prominent global player.</p>
